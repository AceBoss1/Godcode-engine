"""The web door: run and check God Code for the browser playground.

The playground loads this very engine into the browser (through Pyodide,
Python compiled to WebAssembly) and calls the two functions below. Each
returns one JSON-ready dict, shaped like the ``run --json`` and
``check --json`` payloads of :mod:`godcode.agentics`, so the page and an
agent read the same answers.

Every run is sandboxed under the strict policy: no files, no network, no
subprocesses, no stdin, a wall-clock grant and a step budget. Scroll
imports are blessed from the bundled stdlib and from ``library_dir``,
where the playground lays the registry scrolls, so ``IMPORT "blessings"``
works in the browser as it does after ``godcode scroll install``.

Nothing here is browser-only. It is plain Python, kept honest by
``tests/test_webrun.py``, and any host may call it.
